Program-1
Scott is a sweet lover and eats sweets daily. His father is worried about his health 
and gives a task to Scott. If Scott solves the task then he is allowed to eat the sweets.

His task is as follows

Scott is given a word 'W'. Now he is supposed to see, the word is a Balanced Word or Not .

A word is said to be Balanced word if it contains all characters same number of times. 
He can also make the word Balanced by removing  only one occurence of a character at any index in the word. 

If he is able to do so print "true" else print "false"


Sample Test Case-1

input = xyz
output = true

This is Balanced because (x-1,y-1,z-1)

Sample Test Case-2

input = xyzz
output = true

This is Balanced because (x-1,y-1,z-2)
He can remove one occurence of z, It results in (x-1,y-1,z-1)

Sample Test Case-3

input = xxyyzzzz
output = false

This is not Balanced because (x-2,y-2,z-4)
By removing once occurence of z, It results in (x-2,y-2,z-3)
So this is not Balanced

Sample Test Case-4

input = xzxyzxz
output = true

This is Balanced because (x-3,y-1,z-3)
By removing once occurence of y, It results in (x-3,z-3)
So this is  Balanced

Arrays.sort(chCount);

for(i=0;chCount[i]==0;i++);

int minVal = chCount[i];   
int maxVal = chCount[25];

if(minVal == maxVal || maxVal - minVal == 1 && maxVal > chCount[24] ||  minVal == 1 && chCount[i+1] == maxVal)
	return "true";

return "false";

Program-2
Shyam a clever boy, is good in analyzing the words given to him. 
He figures out the speciality of the word in any way. 
Given a word to Shyam, he determines few characters(consecutive) or whole word to be same from left to right and from right to left. 
Print the word which match the above pattern which has the maximum characters in it.
He considers the words which matches the above pattern, has a minimum length of 2. 

If no such word exists print -1

Now Check Shyam is correct or not by writing a code for him. 


for example:
input =abbbabbcbbacdb
output =abbcbba

input=hello
output=ll

input = abcd
output=-1

back end test cases

case =1
input =aaaaa
output =aaaaa

case =2
input =mnghedabcdefghijklkjihgfedcbajdheza
output =abcdefghijklkjihgfedcba

case =3
input =zyxw
output =-1

case =4
input =thedivideriswide
output =edivide

case = 5
input =hellolirilmalayalamliril
output =lirilmalayalamliril
