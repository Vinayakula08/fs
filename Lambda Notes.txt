In Java 8, the language added the ability to write code using another style. 

Functional programming is a way of writing code more declaratively. 

You specify what you want to do rather than dealing with the state of objects. 

You focus more on expressions than loops.

Lambdas work with interfaces that have only one method. 
These are called functional interfaces—interfaces that can be used with functional programming.

Functional programming uses lambda expressions to write code. 

A lambda expression is a block of code that gets passed around. 

You can think of a lambda expression as an continued anonymous method. 

It has parameters and a body just like full-fledged methods do, 
but it doesn’t have a name like a real method. 

Lambda expressions are often referred to as lambdas for short.

In other words, a lambda expression is like a method that you can pass as if it were a variable.
